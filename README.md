# HCI2 COVID-19 Alert Application

Assignment 2 Covid Application with review and changes. The application is designed to inform users of COVID-19 related news and information. The focus for this application is Canadaian cases for COVID-19. Other functions of the application are focussed towards informing the user about symptoms of COVID-19 and ways to help prevent getting or transmitting it. The bottom menu has shortcuts to important features such as FAQs, chat functionality with volounteers, and an emergency assistance.

## Five Extra Desirable Functionalities

- A bluetooth function that tracked all users who have been within 2 meters with eachother. With this function, the data produced can track the spread of the virus more accurately by tracking who had interacted with someone before and after contracting the virus.
- Multi-language support. Canada is home to many different people with different backgrounds. A large number of Canadians might not speak English which leads to them being unable to use the app. Or even if people are less fluent in English, they would be able to switch the language to their native one so they would be able to understand the information better.
- Showing locations of COVID-19 test centers as well as being able to schedule appointments at them.
- Ways to arrange meeting with people during COVID-19 lockdown. A function to allow users to rent out large areas for very few people to maintain social distancing and other safety protocols
- Utilize the native functions of newer smartphones to check for symptoms. Some health applications are designed to track heartrate and some devices like smartwatches track other body functions. Using the information gained from these devices, there might be a way to check if the user is showing symptoms of COVID-19 or not.
